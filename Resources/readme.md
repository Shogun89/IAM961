The course used Numerical Linear Algebra by Trefethan and Bau however I am not entirely sure if it's ok for me to post the pdf of that. Therefore I am posting this book which I found [here](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/classes/nla_2015/numerical_linear_algebra.pdf) from this site by [John Burkardt](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/classes/classes.html)
